I am currently a Master's student at the School of Integrated Circuit Science and Engineering, Beihang University, majoring in Integrated Circuit Science and Engineering, under the supervision of Associate Professor Xueyan Wang. I received my bachelor's degree from the School of Information and Technology, Southwest Jiaotong University, under the supervision of Associate Prof.[Zhixiong Di](https://www.dizhixiong.cn/).

My research interests include designing acceleration algorithms for various real-world applications and accelerating them through FPGA and VLSI implementations.

I’m actively seeking opportunities to pursue a Ph.D. degree starting from Spring/Fall 2026.
